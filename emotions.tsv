happy	Ganbatte! It's not as scary as it sounds!

happy	my sides
happy	one sixty eight's version of Sorairo Days is probably my favourite *-*
happy	Nikki Sixx has Bonfire on his iTunes? Neat.
happy	Naturally! :D
happy	It's a simple Ruby script run as a cron job ^_^
happy	So far found three homes for my copies of @0xabad1dea's novel. Let me know if you're in Melbourne and want one!
happy	You're so old even your kohai have kohai! :p
happy	At least, say, 10 for each emotion. tsv format would be preferable ^^
happy	You're such a dork â™¥
happy	Yay! ^_^ I still have one with me if you're at work today.
happy	At least, say, 10 for each emotion. tsv format would be preferable ^^
happy	I can parse those, yep ^_^
happy	That's a genetics pun :D A misprime is when you accidentally amplify the wrong section of DNA in a polymerase chain reaction
angry	e probably wouldn't want to be a member of a interstellar community that doesn't treat sapient rights as sacrosanct anyway
happy	Elite hacker Cody the Codemaster
happy	Heh, there are a lot of Vocaloid videos along such lines. :D
happy	Albino kiwis. What is it with you and birds lately? :D

happy	She's been floating ideas around for ages but only really started writing out the draft about a year ago
happy	I love that about the Pokemon games.
happy	You should write a children's book called "Adventures of Aspiration the Sparkle Ice Dinosaur"
happy	Wan Shi Tong talking to Jenora about radio is possibly the funniest moment in the season so far. "I ... did not know this" #korra
happy	<3 You are a wonderful force for my self-esteem
happy	The X and Y soundtrack is on iTunes! Which is much less DRM-y than I remember it being. #pokemon
happy	My sister was just accepted into a software engineering degree at RMIT whee :D
happy	This character in particular. Such magnificent coloring!
happy	Confirmed, thank you muchly!
happy	Making a Breton girl now, though I assume you're asleep ^^
angry	Well, historically, a lot of these ideas *were* treated as scientifically valid. And the social effects were not pleasant.
angry	Especially since it was so pointless. I hope if we ever succumb to fascism again they at least have good experimental design
angry	Yes, I'm sure this special stereotype reference class you have just now constructed based on subjective opinion is very different
angry	And you think your own experience has *less* selection bias than statistics provided by dedicated research organizations?
angry	77-84% have completed some kind of tertiary education. This is trivially disprovable, sorry.
angry	You should apply the same scrutiny to the majority responses as you do to the SJ reaction to them.angry	Nope; countries like the US are wealthy and unhappy. The better measure is economic equality.
angry	If you use "methinks", prepare to have the rest of your argument ignored as it's now obvious you've never spoken with people in real life
angry	STOP DISTRACTING ME, TWITTER. I'M LEAVING NOW.
angry	fuck it, I'm going to sleep
angry	My main account is broken at the moment. Cannot tweet, cannot retweet, cannot favourite, etc
angry	I hate my car I hate my car I hate my car
angry	If I have to unclog one more shitty toilet that is not my doing I am going to stab somebody. I have to live here, too, fuckers.
angry	I hate all of you for shit like this

angry	gahhhhhhhhh
angry	I am livid
angry	Did you seriously get the fucking girl I like pissed at me over this
angry	quit yelling at me about my old fucking job because I don't care
angry	My favourite thing about Red Bull is it's cheap enough to get me to buy it and then I hate myself for it because it tastes fucking awful
angry	I bloody hate snow
angry	Yes mum, tell me again about how hard you have it.
angry	Android Gingerbread SUUUUUCKS. I miss my S4.  Pls hurry and fix my camera
angry	good riddance
angry	D:
angry	*works 8 - 10 hour shifts for a week straight*  "Why didn't you do the dishes / everybody else's laundry / other stuff" leave me aLONE
angry	I angrily scream at the soda machine yet it still refuses to take my Confederate dollar bill
angry	Every time you lose in a competitive online game, that can be traced back to a decision you made. Blaming everyone else makes you a loser.
angry	Language evolves. Being outdated is not something to be proud of.
angry	Still can't decide if ignorance or intentional blunt force intimidation. Probably some combination of the two
angry	It really isn't. There are edge cases (notably journalism), but unlike true oppressive regimes, this danger is largely imaginary.
angry	Of all the problems with the USG, the one that happens to mildly inconvenience businesses and educated middle-class techies worries me least
sad	I just feel drained
sad	they seek friendship even though they do not know how to love
sad	I miss getting McDonald's for half price but not enough to work there again
sad	Yes, yes, whatever. You're the better son because you're going to watch him end. Grandma doesn't care if I don't go, so I'm not.
sad	I tried to be skrillex but missed and ended up being skillet :(
sad	There's no dark joke there, that's just the way things are right now
sad	My dad's going to die today
sad	I miss Boid. I made so many little, yet huge suggestions to the interface of that app and it did a lot of things first.
sad	The problems are that sometimes things get to me anyway, and I'm bad at dealing with them on my own, and sometimes I should care but cannot
sad	This has caused the end of many friendships and killed off most romantic relationships before they even started
sad	I used to be such a downer until my nature changed and I stopped letting anything get to me
sad	Oh, hey, Facebook. Thanks for all the photos of me & my ex. Ooops.
sad	yeah I mean I know I'm not attractive but jeez
sad	this hurts me right in the feel
sad	Time to go to work... *sigh*
sad	When I take selfies in-app on Twitter they get all corrupted :( WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME, TWITTER
sad	:( That sucks, man.
sad	I'm hungry :(
sad	very sorrow
sad	Well, that's depressing. I wonder what space tech would look like now if the first human attempt had been a disaster
sad	So emo, Mispy!
sad	Pretty much the only time I've experienced IRL homophobia was one of those. Sympathies!
sad	Nooo little turtle ;-;
sad	I wish my anxiety attacks were that productive
sad	Not feeling especially exuberant today ><
sad	I've had were really just intimate friendships, which is a bit sad. It'd be nice to have a "boyfriend" someday
sad	Mother's family name at birth is such a socially normative security question
loving	It was lovely &lt;3 It's really really nice to just have someone who seems to enjoy doing stuff with me for long time periods
loving	Cute short messy is certainly okay with me :3
loving	Agreed! Too much adorableness for other people to handle
loving	Pushing hair behind ears =&gt; cute
loving	Hmm. I may have a cognitive bias towards believing awesome things about Shuffles
loving	Hehe, sorry Vis. You're also pretty adorable &lt;3
silly	And I here I thought you were just really into wizards
silly	Have fun! Try to avoid making any contracts of unspecified terms with small alien creatures today.
silly	This distinction will be the cause of great theological schisms amongst your followers.
silly	Terrorist spiders just want to be loved
silly	The Shufflesect follows the undying Creed of Cody
silly	We're all jealous of your totally rad, shufflebot
silly	I should like to note, for the record, there is no senpai-initiated ban on arbitrary hair modification :p
excited	Even just upping the death penalty a little would make it suuuuper tense. There is a locked character mode setting
excited	First impression of Starbound: the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic
excited	I still haven't gotten past the main menu screen because the music is SO PRETTY
technical	I might see if I can turn them off once we get right to the very endgame equipment
technical	\"In const we trust\" - @jonascone develops a programming philosophy
technical	I guess twisting tech into doing things it isn't designed to is a useful skill, albeit one you should try to avoid using :D
technical	It does explicitly avoid trying to replace HTML/CSS by forgoing any kind of visual rendering tweaks like centering
technical	Markdown isn't too bad, but it is slightly annoying to preview locally.
technical	Your project repo has a very, um, sparse README :D
technical	This I'm less sure about. In the last generation they didn't, but X/Y definitely have more sophisticated security
technical	Verifying that the data was produced through a particular training process is a *much* harder problem thoug
technical	I should give it a somewhat broader range of emotions to pick from
